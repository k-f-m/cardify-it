## Cardify It! 

Cardify It! is a single page application (SPA) built using React, Vite and Material UI. The SPA generates product cards from form data as well as JSON data received through its API endpoint. 

Under the hood, Cardify It! uses an ASP.NET Core Minimal API endpoint to serve user requests. Moreover, it uses the Entity Framework Core as an Object Relational Mapper (ORM) to create and interact with a SQLite database that stores product data.
